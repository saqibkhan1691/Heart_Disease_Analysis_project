# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Using Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection and preventive care are critical in reducing risk.

This project uses **Tableau** to analyze heart disease data and transform raw healthcare information into interactive dashboards. The aim is to identify key risk factors, uncover hidden trends, and support data-driven decision-making for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and individuals.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Identify major lifestyle and clinical risk factors
* Segment high-risk patient groups
* Analyze demographic patterns (age, gender, BMI, etc.)
* Compare regional disease prevalence
* Create interactive dashboards for better decision-making

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
The Tableau dashboards analyze:

### 1️⃣ Demographic Analysis
* Age-wise distribution of heart disease
* Gender-based comparison
* High-risk age groups

### 2️⃣ Lifestyle Risk Factors
* Smoking impact
* Physical inactivity correlation
* BMI and obesity trends

### 3️⃣ Clinical Indicators
* Cholesterol levels
* Blood pressure impact
* Existing medical conditions

### 4️⃣ Regional Comparison
* Urban vs Rural prevalence
* Region-based disease distribution
